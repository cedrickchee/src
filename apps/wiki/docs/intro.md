# Cedric Chee's Wiki

**_Work-In-Progress (WIP)._**

Hello. Welcome to **InfoWarehouse** — a modern information "warehouse" in the form of a wiki.

This project is part of my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

The public wiki contains "raw materials" (resources) for writing. The resources and lists link to the original full-text source.

I am sharing them in the hope that they would be useful to you as well.

## What kinds of contents

The initial content in this wiki was migrated from [My Knowledge Wiki (GitBook)](https://github.com/cedrickchee/knowledge):

- Notes from courses (educational materials) that I've study. (mostly for fast.ai and Coursera)
- Notes on various programming (technical) topics.
- Notes from books and other interesting things that I've read.

<!-- Previously I used [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for publishing. -->

[**WIP**] This wiki also aggregates some of my lists:

- [Awesome Rust](https://gist.github.com/cedrickchee/f729e848b52eab8fbc88a3910072198c)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-transformer-nlp](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-transformer-nlp)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/chatgpt-universe](https://github.com/cedrickchee/chatgpt-universe)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-wireguard](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-wireguard)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/book-notes](https://github.com/cedrickchee/book-notes)

<!-- If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look here as it 
describes this wiki, its structure and goals. -->

## User Guide

- The order of items in sidebar is alphabetical except notes from courses.
- I will rearrange and rename at any time with no notice.
- This is a public wiki - Terms of use: [TODO]

### Information workflow

I design my note taking system based on a few ideas. One of them is progressive summarization[^1].

I "capture" information from a wide variety of sources into [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori) (a bookmarks manager). Next, I move selected bookmarks to InfoWarehouse.

The 5 layers of summarization[^2]:
- 0: Original full-text source, raw information (i.e.: books, articles, papers, references)
- 1: Notes (i.e.: notes from projects that I've work on, notes from interesting things that I've read)
- 2: Highlighted passages
- 3: Bold passages
- 4: Mini summary (i.e.: notes from books I've read)
- 5: Remix (i.e.: writings, blog posts, micro posts/Tweets)

**InfoWarehouse** is in layer 0.

Once the raw info is processed, it will flow to my digital garden[^3] (built with Obsidian).

### Digital Garden

Layer 1 to 4 is in my digital garden available on https://github.com/cedrickchee/amethyst (WIP).

I **document everything I know** and **learn** so far about the world in the form of a **digital garden**.

I also want to remember more [of what I read](http://austinkleon.com/2016/03/03/how-to-read-more-2/), so I take notes to share [compressed wisdom](https://sivers.org/2do).

## How to use the wiki effectively?

In the right corner, you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

## Other things I wrote and shared

I share my knowledge in a longer form by writing [articles](https://cedricchee.com). I also love writing code and share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/cedrickchee). You can find all the things I have made and shared thus far [here](https://github.com/cedrickchee#projects).
