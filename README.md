# InfoWarehouse

> [!NOTE]
> Work-In-Progress (WIP).

InfoWarehouse â€” a modern information "warehouse" in the form of a **wiki**.

This project is part of my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).

The public wiki contains "raw materials" (resources) for writing. The resources and lists link to the original full-text source.

I am sharing them in the hope that they would be useful to you as well.

The wiki is available on:

- Website: https://wiki.cedricchee.com
- Github: https://github.com/cedrickchee/src

## What kinds of contents

The initial content in this wiki was migrated from [My Knowledge Wiki (GitBook)](https://github.com/cedrickchee/knowledge):

- Notes from courses (educational materials) that I've study. (mostly for fast.ai and Coursera)
- Notes on various programming (technical) topics.
- Notes from books and other interesting things that I've read.

<!-- Previously I used [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for publishing. -->

[**WIP**] This wiki also aggregates some of my lists:

- [Awesome Rust](https://gist.github.com/cedrickchee/f729e848b52eab8fbc88a3910072198c)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-transformer-nlp](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-transformer-nlp)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/chatgpt-universe](https://github.com/cedrickchee/chatgpt-universe)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-wireguard](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-wireguard)
- [https://github.com/cedrickchee/book-notes](https://github.com/cedrickchee/book-notes)

<!-- If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look here as it 
describes this wiki, its structure and goals. -->

## User Guide

- The order of items in sidebar is alphabetical except notes from courses.
- I will rearrange and rename at any time with no notice.
- This is a public wiki - Terms of use: [TODO]

### Information workflow

I design my note taking system based on a few ideas. One of them is progressive summarization[^1].

I "capture" information from a wide variety of sources into [Shiori](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori) (a bookmarks manager). Next, I move selected bookmarks to `src`.

The 5 layers of summarization[^2]:
- 0: Original full-text source, raw information (i.e.: books, articles, papers, references)
- 1: Notes (i.e.: notes from projects that I've work on, notes from interesting things that I've read)
- 2: Highlighted passages
- 3: Bold passages
- 4: Mini summary (i.e.: notes from books I've read)
- 5: Remix (i.e.: writings, blog posts, micro posts/Tweets)

**InfoWarehouse** is in layer 0.

Once the raw info is processed, it will flow to my digital garden[^3] (built with Obsidian).

## PKM Tools

This project is a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) monorepo setup.

The setup was based on an official pnpm starter turborepo.

I created this turborepo by following the [tutorial here](https://cedricchee.com/blog/turborepo-monorepo/).

### What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

#### Apps and Packages

- `wiki`: a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) app
- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

#### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Installation

We use pnpm as the package manager. At the root of the repository, run `pnpm i` to install the monorepo dependencies.

```sh
cd src
pnpm i
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd src
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd src
pnpm run dev
```

**Running `dev` on only one workspace at a time:**

By default, `pnpm run dev` will run `dev` on all workspaces at once. But sometimes, we might only want to choose one workspace.

To handle this, we can add a `--filter` flag to our command. This `--filter` gets passed to the `turbo` CLI.

```sh
pnpm run dev --filter wiki
```

Alternatively, run:

```sh
pnpm run dev:wiki
```

### Deployment

On every commit, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) that is hooked up to the GitHub repo runs Docusaurus and new version of wiki is published.

Please read ["Using Monorepos with Vercel dashboard" docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos#using-monorepos-with-vercel-dashboard) if you would like to learn how I set up all this.

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd src
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
